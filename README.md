# Simple-Shell

Design and implement a simple, interactive shell program that prompts the user for a command, parses
the command, and then executes it with a child process. In your solution you are required to use
execv(), which means that you will have to read the PATH environment, then search each directory in
the PATH for the command file name that appears on the command line.
